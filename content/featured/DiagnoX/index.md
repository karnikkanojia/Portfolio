DiagnoX was developed to assist doctors in interpreting X-rays. It uses advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze X-rays and provide a preliminary diagnosis. This preliminary diagnosis is presented to the doctor, who can then confirm or modify it based on their own expertise.

DiagnoX is designed to be highly user-friendly, with a simple interface that can be easily integrated into a hospital's existing system. The system is also highly customizable, allowing doctors to modify the algorithms and criteria used for diagnosis based on their preferences.
